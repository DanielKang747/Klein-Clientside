# Klein-Clientside
A client-side instructional material framework

## Overview

Klein-Clientside is a client-side web framework for authoring and displaying instructional material.  It is based around the concept of a "book", which contains "pages".  The pages are the content that you display to your students.  Klein includes facilities to author content using a markdown-like syntax.  One of the key features of Klein is the answerbox, which allows students to test their understanding.  The answerboxes are checked using a "How did I do?" button, which tells the student if they are right or wrong.  

Klein clientside is currently not able to store user data or grades, and as such is currently useful for lab manuals and practice but not for graded assignments.

## Klein's Components

Klein consists of two components: a python script for converting the content and a Javascript/css/html web front-end for displaying the content.
